Point Cloud Void Region Interpolation
Project Overview
This project focuses on filling void regions within a point cloud dataset using interpolation techniques. Point clouds are sets of data points in a 3D coordinate system, often collected through various sensing technologies like LiDAR or photogrammetry. In many cases, point cloud datasets can contain areas with sparse or missing data, referred to as "void regions." The goal of this project is to develop a solution that intelligently generates new points within these void regions and interpolates their values based on the surrounding points.

Project Highlights
Problem Statement: Point cloud datasets often have regions with low point density, resulting in void areas where important details might be missing. This project aims to address this issue by filling these void regions using interpolation.

Data Preprocessing: The project begins by dividing the dataset into a grid of cells. The density of points within each cell is calculated, and void regions are identified based on a user-defined threshold density.

Interpolation: For each identified void region, the project generates new points within the void region based on the difference between the average density and the density of the void region. The new points are interpolated using cubic interpolation based on the existing points in the dataset.

Integration: The newly generated points are merged with the original point cloud data. Additionally, the interpolated values are used to fill the void regions in the original dataset.

Usage: The project provides a structured pipeline that takes a point cloud dataset as input and outputs an updated dataset with filled void regions. This improved dataset can be used for further analysis, visualization, or other applications.

Getting Started
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, and scipy.

Dataset: Prepare your point cloud dataset in CSV format, containing columns for X, Y, and Z coordinates.

Configuration: Adjust parameters like cell size and density threshold to suit your specific dataset.

Execution: Run the provided script to perform void region identification, interpolation, and dataset update.

Results: The updated dataset with filled void regions will be saved as a new CSV file.
